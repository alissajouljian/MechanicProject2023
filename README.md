Initially, the image undergoes preprocessing involving the conversion to grayscale,
the application of blur for noise reduction, and the use of dilatation and morphological operations to highlight specific features. 
Following this, a classification process takes place based on features such as letter thickness, word distance, and the application of K-means and SVM algorithms.
Feature extraction focuses on characteristics like letter thickness and word distance. 
Among the machine learning models employed, K-means is used for clustering, while SVM emerges as the most effective classifier.
